Detailed Description : 
The goal was to analyze the performance of overall company sales. Firstly, I connected to the database, queried the desired tables, and exported them to an Excel format since I am using Tableau Public, which doesn't allow direct database connections. Then, I cleaned the data using Tableau data filters and created an interactive dashboard for easier navigation and comparison. This facilitated stakeholders in assessing the company's sales performance.
